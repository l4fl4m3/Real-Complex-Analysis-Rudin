\subsection*{Exercise 1}
Does there exist an infinite $\sigma$-algebra which has only countably many members?
\\\\
\textbf{Solution:}
No. Impossible.

\subsection*{Exercise 2}
Prove an analog of Theorem 1.8 for $n$ functions.
\\\\
\textbf{Solution:}
We have that $u_1, u_2, ..., u_n$ are real measurable functions on a measurable space.
\\\\We let $f(x) = (u_1(x), u_2(x), ..., u_n(x))$.
Since $h = \Phi \circ f$, Theorem 1.7 shows that it is enough to prove measurability of $f$.
\\\\We let $B = I_1 \times I_2 \times ... \times I_n$. We then have $f(B) = (u_1(I_1), u_2(I_2)), ... , u_n(I_n)$.
We then have that $f^{-1}(B) = u_1^{-1}(I_1) \cap u_2^{-1}(I_2) \cap ... \cap u_n^{-1}(I_n)$,
which is measurable by our measurability assumption on $u_1, u_2, ..., u_n$.
\\\\Every open set $V$ in $I_1 \times I_2 \times ... \times I_n$ is a countable union of such $B$ which we call $B_i$.
Hence we have that $f^{-1}(V)=f^{-1}(\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{\infty} B_i) = \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{\infty} f^{-1}(B_i)$.
Hence $f^{-1}(V)$ is measurable. $\quad \square$

\subsection*{Exercise 3}
Prove that if $f$ is a real function on a measurable space $X$ such that $\{ x:f(x) \ge r\}$ is measurable
for every rational $r$, then $f$ is measurable.
\\\\
\textbf{Solution:}
We know that $f$ is measurable if for every open set $V$ in $\mathcal{O}_{std}$, $f^{-1}(V)$ is measurable set.
Here $\mathcal{O}_{std}:\{ (a,b): a < x < b \ \forall x \in \mathbb{R} \}$ is the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ and is just the collection of all open intervals $(a,b)$.
We know that $\{x \in X: f(x) \ge q\}$ is a measurable set $ \forall q \in \mathbb{Q}$. Since we know that $\mathbb{Q}$ is a dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$, we can always get arbitrarily close to any $r \in \mathbb{R}$.
We let $\forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \ (q_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a decreasing sequence in $\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\lim_{n\to\infty} q_n = r$.
We then have that $\{x \in X: f(x) > r\} = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \{ x \in X: f(x) > q_n\}$.
By definition, the right hand side is measurable, hence every $r$ is measurable.
Hence, for every open interval in $ I \in \mathcal{O}_{std}$, $f^{-1}(I)$ is a measurable set, hence $f$ is measurable.


\subsection*{Exercise 4}
Let $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ be sequences in $[-\infty, \infty]$, and prove the following assertions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]  \[\limsup_{n\to\infty} (-a_n) = - \liminf_{n\to\infty} a_n \]
    \item[(b)]  \[\limsup_{n\to\infty} (a_n + b_n) \le \limsup_{n\to\infty} a_n + \limsup_{n\to\infty} b_n \]\\
    provided none of the sums is of the form $\infty - \infty$.
    \item[(c)] If $a_n \le b_n$ for all $n$, then 
        \[ \liminf_{n\to\infty} a_n \le \liminf_{n\to\infty} b_n\]
\end{enumerate}
Show by an example that strict inequality can hold for (b).
\\\\
\textbf{Solution:}
\\\\
a) 
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        \limsup_{n\to\infty} (-a_n) &= \inf_{n\ge0} \sup_{m\ge n} (-a_m)\\
        &= \inf_{n\ge0} (- \inf_{m\ge n} a_m)\\
        &= - \sup_{n\ge0} \inf_{m\ge n} a_m\\
        & = - \liminf_{n\to\infty} (a_n)\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\\
b)
We let $a_n = \sup_{m \ge n} a_m$ and $ b_n = \sup_{m \ge n} b_m$.
It is trivial that $A \subseteq B \implies \sup A \le \sup B$.
We can then observe that $\forall m \ge n,\ a_n \ge a_m$ and $b_n \ge b_m$. Hence we have that: 
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        a_n + b_n &\ge a_m + b_m \\
        \sup_{m \ge n} (a_n + b_n) = a_n + b_n &\ge \sup_{m \ge n} (a_m + b_m)\\
        \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n + b_n) &\ge \lim_{n\to\infty}\sup_{m \ge n} (a_m + b_m)\\
        \lim_{n\to\infty} (\sup_{m \ge n} a_m + \sup_{m \ge n} b_m) &\ge \lim_{n\to\infty}\sup_{m \ge n} (a_m + b_m)\\
        \lim_{n\to\infty}\sup_{m \ge n} a_m + \lim_{n\to\infty}\sup_{m \ge n} b_m &\ge \lim_{n\to\infty}\sup_{m \ge n} (a_m + b_m)\\
        \limsup_{n\to\infty} a_n + \limsup_{n\to\infty} b_n &\ge \limsup_{n\to\infty}(a_n +b_n) \quad \square   
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\\
c)
We have that $\forall n$:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        \inf_{m \ge n} a_m &\le \inf_{m \ge n} b_m\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Where for the sequences $(\inf_{m \ge n} a_m)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and $(\inf_{m \ge n} b_m)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ we have:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        \lim_{n\to\infty}\inf_{m \ge n} a_m &\le \lim_{n\to\infty}\inf_{m \ge n} b_m\\
        \liminf_{n\to\infty} a_n &\le \liminf_{n\to\infty} b_n \quad \square
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\subsection*{Exercise 5}
(a) Suppose $f: X \rightarrow [-\infty, \infty]$ and $g:X \rightarrow [-\infty, \infty]$ are measurable. Prove that the sets $ \{ x: f(x) < g(x) \}, \{ x: f(x) = g(x)\}$ are measurable.
\\\\
(b) Prove that the set of points at which a sequence of measurable real-valued functions converges
(to a finite limit) is measurable. 
\\\\
\textbf{Solution:}
\\\\
a) Since $f$ and $g$ are measurable, from Excercise 3, we can deduce that $\forall q \in \mathbb{Q}, \ \{x:f(x) \ge q\}$ and $\{x:g(x) \ge q\}$ are measurable sets. Hence their complements and strict inequality conditioned sets
$\{x:f(x) < q\}, \{x:g(x) < q\}, \{x:f(x) > q\}, \{x:g(x) > q\}, \{x:g(x) \le q\}, \{x:g(x) \le q\}$ are also measurable. We then have that $\{x:f(x) < g(x)\}, \{x: f(x) = g(x)\} & \iff \{x:f(x) \le g(x)\} = X$. Then we have:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        X^C = \{x:f(x) > g(x)\} &= \bigcup\limits_{q\in\mathbb{Q}}\left\{\{x:f(x) > q\} \cap \{x:g(x) < q\} \right\}\\
            &= \bigcup\limits_{q\in\mathbb{Q}}\left\{\{x:f(x) \le q\} \cup \{x:g(x) \ge q\} \right\}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
which measurable since it is the union of countably many measurable sets. 
Hence we have that $(X^C)^C = X$ is measurable.
\\\\
b) If we have a sequence of real-valued measurable functions $(f_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ which converge to a finite limit say $a$,
we know that:
\[ \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n = a \iff \liminf_{n\to\infty} f_n = \limsup_{n\to\infty} f_n = a \]
By \textbf{Theorem 1.14} we know that $h = \limsup_{n\to\infty}f_n$ and $g = \sup_{n\ge 1} f_n$ are measurable.
From these it follows that $\inf_{n\ge1}f_n$ and $\liminf_{n\to\infty}f_n$ are measurable.
Then we have that $\{ x: \liminf_{n\to\infty} f_n = \limsup_{n\to\infty} \} = X$ and:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        X^C = \{ x: \liminf_{n\to\infty} f_n > \limsup_{n\to\infty} \} \cup \{ x: \liminf_{n\to\infty} f_n < \limsup_{n\to\infty} \}\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
which we know by (a) to be measurable. Hence $X$ is measurable.

\subsection*{Exercise 6}
Let $X$ be an uncountable set, let $\mathfrak{M}$ be the collection of all sets $E \subset X$ such that
such that either $E$ or $E^C$ is at most countable, and define $\mu(E) = 0$ in the first case, $\mu(E)=1$ in the
second. Prove that $\mathfrak{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra in $X$ and that $\mu$ is a measure on $\mathfrak{M}$. Describe
the corresponding measurable functions and their integrals.
\\\\
\textbf{Solution:}
By defintion $X,  \emptyset \in \mathfrak{M}$. Additionally if $E \in \mathfrak{M}$, then $E^C \in \mathfrak{M}$.
We then let $E = \cup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i$ where $E_i \in \mathfrak{M}$. If all $E_i$ are countable then we have that $E$ is
also countable, since a countable union of countable sets is countable, hence $E \in \mathfrak{M}$. If $\exists E_{i_u}$ such that $E_{i_u}^C$ is countable,
then $E^C = \cap_{i=1}^{\infty}E_i^C \subseteq E_{i_u}^C$, and hence $E^C$ is countable, hence $E \in \mathfrak{M}$. Hence $\mathfrak{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra in $X$.
\\\\
We then look at $\mu$. We let $E = \cup_{i=1}^{\infty}E_i$ be a countable collection of pairwise disjoint sets $E_i \in \mathfrak{M}$. Similar to before
if all $E_{i}$ are countable then $E$ is countable and hence $\Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(E_i) = \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty} 0 = 0= \mu(E)$.
If $\exists E_{i_{k}}$ such that $E_{i_{k}}^C$ is countable, then $E^C$ is countable. Hence $\Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(E_i) = \Sigma_{i=1, i \neq i_k}^{\infty} \mu(E_i) + \mu(E_{i_k}) = \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty}0 + 1 = 1 = \mu(E)$.
Hence we have that $\mu(\cup_{i=1}^{\infty}E_i) = \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(E_i)$. Hence $\mu$ is a measure on $\mathfrak{M}$.
\\\\
Let $f: X \rightarrow R$, where $R$ is an arbitrary range. We know that if $f$ is measurable then either $f^{-1}(x)$ or $(f^{-1}(x))^C$ is measurable and hence countable.
If we have that $(f^{-1}(x))^C$ is countable then by the measure $\mu$ that we have $f(x)$ is almost constant.

\subsection*{Exercise 7}
Suppose $f_n:X \to [0, \infty]$ is measurable for $n=1,2,3,..., f_1 \ge f_2 \ge f_3 \ge ... \ge 0, \ f_n(x) \to f(x)$ as $n \to \infty$,
for every $x \in X$, and $f_1 \in L^1(\mu)$. Prove that then
\[ \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_X f_n \,d\mu = \int_X f \,d\mu \]
and show that this conclusion does \textit{not} follow if the condition ``$ f_1 \in L^1(\mu)$'' is omitted.
\\\\
\textbf{Solution:}
If $\forall x \in X, \ f_1(x) < \infty $.
We have that $\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x) = f(x)$ where each $f_n$ is measurable on $X$. We also have that $f_1(x) \ge f_n(x) \ge 0$ hence $|f_n(x)| \le f_1(x) \in L^1(\mu)$.
By Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence Theorem (LDCT), the conclusion then follows.
\\\\ 
Else we can let $E = \{ x \in X : f_1(x) = \infty\}$. If we assume that $\mu(E) > 0$, then we also have that $\int_X|f_1|d\mu = \infty$, but since $f_1 \in L^1(\mu)$, this is
a contradiction, hence $\mu(E) = 0$. Therefore we have that $\int_X|f_1|d\mu = \int_{X\setminus E}|f_1|d\mu + \int_E|f_1|d\mu = \int_{X\setminus E}|f_1|d\mu < \infty$.
Hence the conclusion again follows by above.
\\\\
As seen above if ``$f_1\in L^1(\mu)$'' is omitted, the conclusion does not follow.  

\subsection*{Exercise 8}
Put $f_n = \chi_E$ if $n$ is odd, $f_n=1-\chi_E$ if $n$ is even. What is the relavance of this example to Fatou's Lemma ?
\\\\
\textbf{Solution:}

\subsection*{Exercise 9}
Suppose $\mu$ is a positive measure on $X, f: X \to [0,\infty]$ is measurable, $\int_X f d\mu = c$, where $0<c<\inf$,
and $\alpha$ is a constant. Prove that
\[ \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_X n \log [1+(f/n)^\alpha]\ d\mu = 
    \begin{cases} 
        \infty & \text{if} \ 0<\alpha<1\\
        c & \text{if} \ \alpha = 1\\
        0 & \text{if} \ 1<\alpha<\infty
    \end{cases}
\]
\\\\
\textbf{Solution:}

\subsection*{Exercise 10}
Suppose $\mu(X)<\infty$, $\{f_n\}$ is a sequence of bounded complex measurable functions on $X$,
and $f_n \to f$ uniformly on $X$. Prove that
\[ \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_X f_n \,d\mu  = \int_X f_n \,d\mu\]
and show that the hypothesis ``$\mu(X) < \infty$'' cannot be omitted.
\\\\
\textbf{Solution:}
Since we have a sequence of bounded complex measurable functions, we have that $|f_n(x)| \le g(x) $, where $g(x)$ is some bound.
Since $\mu(X) < \infty$, then $\int_X |g(x)| < \infty$, hence $g(x) \in L^1(\mu)$.
By uniform convergence, we also have that $f(x) = \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x)$. The conclusion then follows by LDCT.
\\\\
If ``$\mu(X) < \infty$'' is omitted, then we can have $\int_X |g(x)| = \infty$, and hence $g(x) \notin L^1(\mu)$ and hence LDCT does not apply,
and the conclusion does not follow.
\subsection*{Exercise 11}
Show that
\[ A = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{k=n}^{\infty} E_k\]
in Theorem 1.41, and hence prove the theorem without any reference to integration.
\\\\
\textbf{Solution:}
If $x \in \bigcup_{k \in K} E_k$ then $x$ is in at least one of the $E_k$. If $x \in \bigcap_{k \in K} E_k$ then $x$ is in all of the $E_k$.
Hence we can conclude that $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{k=n}^{\infty} E_k$ are all the elements in either $E_n, E_{n+1}, E_{n+2}, ...$, without regard for the
the size of $n$. Hence this must be the same as being part of infinitely many of the $E_k$.
\\\\
More formally, if $x$ is in infinitely many $E_k$, then for all $n=1,2,3,..., \infty \  \exists \, k> n: x\in E_k$.
Hence $x \in \bigcup_{k=n}^{\infty} E_k$, however it is so for all $n$, hence it is in the interesection of all such unions,
hence $x \in \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{k=n}^{\infty} E_k$. For the other direction, it is enough to show that if $x$ is not in
infinitely many $E_k$ then $A \neq \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{k=n}^{\infty} E_k$. Hence, if $x$ is not in infinitely many $E_k$, 
then there is some largest $k$ and hence $E_k$ in which $x$ lies.
Therefore, $\exists \, n>k: x\notin \bigcup_{k=n}^{\infty} E_k$. Hence $x \notin \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{k=n}^{\infty} E_k \quad \square$
\\\\
We let $F_n = \cup_{k=n}^{\infty} E_k$. From this it is obvious that $F_{n+1} \subset F_n$. 
We then have that 
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mu(A) &= \mu(\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}F_n)\\
        &= \lim_{n\to\infty} \mu(F_n) \quad (\text{Theorem 1.19 (e)})\\
        &= \lim_{n\to\infty} \mu(\bigcup_{k=n}^{\infty}E_k)\\
        &\le \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{k=n}^{\infty} \mu(E_k) = 0\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
since we know that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\mu(E_k) < \infty$, as well as the fact that the tail must go to 0 (Theorem 3.23, Principles of Mathematical Analysis; Rudin).

\subsection*{Exercise 12}
Suppose $f \in L^1(\mu)$. Prove that to each $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta>0$ such that $\int_E |f| \,d\mu < \epsilon$
whenever $\mu(E) < \delta$.
\\\\
\textbf{Solution:}
Since $f\in L^1(\mu)$ we know that $\int_E |f| \, d\mu$ is finite.
By definition $\int_E |f| \, d\mu = \sup \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \alpha_i \mu(A_i \cap E)$.
In addition we know that $\mu(E) < \delta$. Therefore for each $\epsilon$ we can choose $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i}$.
hence we have:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        \int_E |f| \, d\mu &= \sup \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \mu(A_i \cap E)\\
        &\le \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \mu(A_i \cap E)\\
        &\le \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \mu(E)  = \mu(E) \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i = \delta \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i = \epsilon \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\subsection*{Exercise 13}
Show that proposition 1.24(c) is also true when $c = \infty$.
\\\\
\textbf{Solution:}
If $f = 0$, then we have that $\int_E cf \,d\mu = \int_E \infty \cdot 0 \,d\mu = \int_E 0 \,d\mu = 0 = \infty \cdot 0 = \infty \cdot \int_E 0 \,d\mu =  c \int_E f \,d\mu$.
\\\\
If $f > 0$, we know that $\infty \cdot f = \infty \ \forall f>1$.
Then we have that if $\mu(E) = 0$ then $\int_E cf \,d\mu = 0 =  c \int_E f \,d\mu$.
If $\mu(E) \neq 0$, then $\int_E cf \,d\mu = \int_E \infty \cdot f \,d\mu = \int_E \infty \,d\mu = \infty = \infty \cdot \int_E f \,d\mu = c\int_E f \,d\mu$.
